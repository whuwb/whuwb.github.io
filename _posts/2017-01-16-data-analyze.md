## Process

[The Data Science Process: What a data scientist actually does day-to-day][1]给了我一些启迪:

> Over time, I realized that despite the variation in the details of defferent projects, the steps that data scientists use to work through a complex business problem remain more or less the same.

> This process invloles several important steps:

> + *Frame the problem:* Who is your client? What exactly is the client asking you to solve? How can you translate their ambiguous request into a concrete, well defined problem?

> + *Collect the raw data needed to Solve the problem:* Is this data already available? If so, what parts of the data are useful? If not, what more data do you need? What kind of resources(time, money, infrasturcture) would it take to collect this data in a usable form?

> + "Process the data(data wrangling):" Real, raw data is rarely usable out of the box. There are errors in data collection, corrupt records, missing values and many other challenges you will have to manage. You will first need to clean the data to convert it to a form that you can further analyze.

> + "Explore the data:" Once you have cleaned the data, you have to understand the information contained within at a high level. What kinds of obvious trends or correlations do you see in the data? What are the high-level characteristics and are any of them more significant than others?

> + "Communicate results of the analysis:" All the analysis and technical results that you come up with are of little value unless you can explain to your stakeholders what they mean, in a way that's comprehensible and compelling. Data storytelling is a crtical and underrated skill that you will build and use here.
